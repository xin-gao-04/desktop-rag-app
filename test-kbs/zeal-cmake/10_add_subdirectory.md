# add_subdirectory¶

Add a subdirectory to the build.

add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [SYSTEM])

Adds a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the
directory in which the source CMakeLists.txt and code files are
located. If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated with respect
to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an
absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory in which to
place the output files. If it is a relative path, it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an
absolute path. If binary_dir is not specified, the value of
source_dir, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the
typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source
directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in
the current input file continues beyond this command.

If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL property will be set on the added directory.
This will exclude the directory from a default build. See the directory
property EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL for full details.

Added in version 3.25: If the SYSTEM argument is provided, the SYSTEM directory
property of the subdirectory will be set to true. This property is
used to initialize the SYSTEM property of each non-imported
target created in that subdirectory.
